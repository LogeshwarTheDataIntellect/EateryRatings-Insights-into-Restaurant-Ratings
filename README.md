#EateryRatings: Insights into Restaurant Ratings

# Cognifyz: Where Data Meets Intelligence

## Overview
Cognifyz is a data analysis project focused on the restaurant industry. It explores various aspects of restaurant data to uncover insights that optimize business strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Structure

### Level 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

#### Task 1: Explore the Dataset
- **Dimensions:** Identified the dataset dimensions (rows and columns).
- **Missing Values:** Handled missing values appropriately.
- **Data Types:** Conducted necessary data type conversions.
- **Target Variable Analysis:** Analyzed the distribution of "Aggregate rating" for class imbalances.

#### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
- **Statistical Measures:** Calculated basic statistics for numerical columns.
- **Categorical Variables:** Explored distributions of "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
- **Top Cuisines and Cities:** Identified cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

#### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
- **Visualization:** Mapped restaurant locations using latitude and longitude data.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Analyzed restaurant distribution across different cities and countries.
- **Correlation:** Investigated correlations between restaurant location and ratings.

### Level 2: Advanced Analysis

#### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
- **Availability:** Determined the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
- **Rating Comparison:** Compared average ratings between restaurants with and without table booking.
- **Online Delivery by Price Range:** Analyzed online delivery availability across different price ranges.

#### Task 2: Price Range Analysis
- **Common Price Range:** Identified the most common price range among restaurants.
- **Rating by Price Range:** Calculated average ratings for each price range.
- **Highest Rating Color:** Determined the color representing the highest average rating among different price ranges.

#### Task 3: Feature Engineering
- **Additional Features:** Extracted features such as restaurant name or address length.
- **Binary Features:** Created binary features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" from categorical variables.

### Level 3: Advanced Modeling and Analysis

#### Task 1: Predictive Modeling
- **Regression Models:** Built regression models to predict restaurant ratings.
- **Model Evaluation:** Split the dataset, evaluated model performance, and compared algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest).

#### Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis
- **Cuisine Analysis:** Analyzed relationships between cuisine types and restaurant ratings.
- **Popular Cuisines:** Identified popular cuisines based on customer votes.
- **High-Rating Cuisines:** Determined specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.

#### Task 3: Data Visualization
- **Rating Distributions:** Created visualizations (histograms, bar plots) to depict rating distributions.
- **Comparative Visualizations:** Compared average ratings across different cuisines or cities.
- **Feature Relationships:** Visualized relationships between various features and the target variable to derive insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data analytics techniques to uncover insights in the restaurant industry. By leveraging descriptive analysis, geospatial analysis, advanced modeling, and data visualization, it aims to optimize restaurant management strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
